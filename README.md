# odin-recipes
In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website. I will have demonstrated the skills I have learned from the Odin Project, inclusing some basic HTML and how to use Git. I will also be working from WSL, so it will help to increase my adeptness in working with any challenges that might arise from this approach.
