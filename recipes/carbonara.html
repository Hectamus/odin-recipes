    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>The required ingredients for this recipe include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces (225 grams) of fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>4 ounces (113 grams) of pancetta or bacon, diced into small pieces</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup (100 grams) of grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Salt to taste (optional)</li>
        <li>Chopped fresh parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <p> To cook this delicious meal, you can follow these steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fettuccine pasta 
            and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain the
             cooked pasta, reserving some of the pasta water.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add
             the diced pancetta or bacon and cook until it becomes crispy and browned.
              Remove the cooked pancetta from the skillet and set it aside on a paper
               towel-lined plate to drain excess grease.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated Parmesan cheese, and
             freshly ground black pepper until well combined.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and return the cooked pasta to the skillet with
             the pancetta. Pour the egg mixture over the pasta, tossing quickly and
              continuously to coat the pasta evenly. The heat from the pasta will 
              gently cook the eggs, creating a creamy sauce. If the mixture seems 
              too thick, you can gradually add a small amount of the reserved pasta
               water to loosen it.</li>
        <li>Once the pasta is well coated with the sauce and heated through, remove
             the skillet from the heat. Be careful not to overcook the sauce, as the
              eggs may scramble.</li>
        <li>Taste the fettuccine carbonara and season with salt if desired. Remember
             that the pancetta or bacon already adds saltiness, so be cautious while
              adding salt.</li>
        <li>Serve the fettuccine carbonara immediately, garnished with chopped fresh
             parsley if desired. Enjoy the creamy and flavorful pasta while it's 
             still hot.</li>
      </ol>
